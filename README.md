reviews app implemented using express framework and dust template


This is the next evolution of my book reviews app which can be found here: https://github.com/DenisOS/reviews

In this repository I implement the same app using express web framework with dust templates. Please see my blog post here for more details: http://webslainte.blogspot.com/2012/12/nodejs-convert-reviews-app-to-use.html

The differences
- express makes your life alot simpler
- using dust templates with express is a good fit, I like that dust uses straight html (unlike jade) and dust provides powerful functionality such as master layout and decorator.
